/*Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

Example
scores = [12, 24, 10, 24]

Scores are in the same order as the games played. She tabulates her results as follows:

                                     Count
    Game  Score  Minimum  Maximum   Min Max
     0      12     12       12       0   0
     1      24     12       24       0   1
     2      10     10       24       1   1
     3      24     10       24       1   1
Given the scores for a season, determine the number of times Maria breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.
